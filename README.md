# Github Tips


### Features in README file  

To start a new line, make sure you have (at least) two spaces behind your last word in the previous line. If it's only a single space, you will still have the sentences together on the same line even when you have started them on a new line in your README file.   

Three dashes (---) gives you the line you see below. 

--- 

If you enter the three dashes right under a chunk of text, that chunk of text is going to look like this. 
---


If you start with a # and then some words following it, the text size will be that of "Github Tips" at the top of this README file. If you start with three #, then the text size you see will be similar to that of "Fork" and "Clone" below.  

---

If you would like to create a new folder, click "Create new file", and then type the name of the folder as you would like it to be behind the / while initializing a new README file (eg. image/README.md). This is because Github doesn't allow an empty folder to be created.   

---

If you would like to insert images in README, one way to do it is to upload the image into your github repository. You can choose to upload it into a folder (which you can create it based on the instructions above). Then type `<img src="insert_link_address_of_image_here">`. If you want, you can edit the width and height behind the link, eg. `<img src="insert_link_address_of_image_here" width="200" height="200">`.   

---

If you want the text to appear "code"-like, embrace your code within this symbol, i.e. start and end your code with  ` .   

More options relating to styling such as bold and italics in README can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).  

---

If you want to insert a hyperlink, embrace the text intended for the hyperlink within [ ] and then input the link within ( ). i.e. `[text](link)`.

### Features on Github  

You can edit the README directly (click on the pencil you see at the right corner of the README header). Some common buttons I use are Create new file/ Upload files.

### Fork
If you want to perform changes to someone's work/ repository, fork it first. Create the necessary changes you would like then do a pull request. You can try forking this repo to your own Github and then make edits to the README file to get a taste of how things work in README.   

### Clone  
If you want to "download" the repository to your desktop (i.e. local), clone the repository. And of course, if you would like to use Github via common line interface, that's also possible. For which, you have to download/ install Git.   

### Creating new repository
